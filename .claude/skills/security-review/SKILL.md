# Security & Compliance Review

Perform an end-to-end security and compliance review and produce a prioritized, actionable remediation plan with a security-readiness verdict.

## Scoping

If the user specifies a target (example: `/security-review apps/api`), review only that app or package. Otherwise review the full codebase.

If the user specifies a phase (example: `/security-review authn only`), run only that section.
Valid phase keywords: `preflight`, `discover`, `authn`, `authz`, `input`, `data`, `secrets`, `audit`, `deps`, `network`, `container`, `compliance`, `gates`, `bugs`, `backlog`, `quickwins`.

If target includes `/`, generate a safe output slug: replace `/` with `-`, remove spaces.

## Operating Rules

- Evidence-first: cite exact files and line numbers.
- Separate `confirmed` evidence from `inferred` conclusions.
- Never claim a check passed unless you ran or inspected it.
- If evidence is missing, state the gap and how to obtain it.
- Every recommendation must include: `what`, `where`, `how`, and `verify`.
- Prefer small, reversible fixes; propose phased migration for larger remediations.
- Recommend one default path when options exist; give short rationale.
- Prioritize: Authentication bypass -> Authorization bypass -> Data exposure -> Injection -> Configuration -> Hardening.
- Save final report to `docs/reviews/security-review-{targetSlug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.

## Quality Bar (Definition of Done)

The review is complete only when all are present:

- Attack surface map with entry points and trust boundaries.
- Findings for all requested categories with evidence.
- Every finding has severity, confidence, and verification steps.
- Compliance checklist against applicable standards.
- QA gate scorecard with `PASS` / `PARTIAL` / `FAIL`.
- Security verdict (`SECURE` / `AT-RISK` / `CRITICAL`) with blocking issues listed.
- Prioritized remediation backlog and quick-win plan.

## Severity, Confidence, and Risk

Use these fields for every finding:

- `Severity`: `P0` (critical — active exploit risk), `P1` (high — fix this sprint), `P2` (medium — next sprint), `P3` (low — hardening)
- `Confidence`: `High` (direct evidence), `Medium` (strong inference), `Low` (hypothesis)
- `Status`: `Confirmed`, `Partially Confirmed`, `Unverified`

Risk scoring:

`Risk Score = Impact (1-5) x Likelihood (1-5)`

Risk Score to severity mapping: `16-25 = P0`, `9-15 = P1`, `4-8 = P2`, `1-3 = P3`.

### False-Positive Triage

When a search pattern matches a non-vulnerable usage, mark it `FP` with a one-line justification. Common false positives:

- `password` in schema/type definitions (not hardcoded secrets)
- `eval(` in comments or documentation
- `exec(` in ORM/DB driver internals inside `node_modules`
- Template literal SQL that is actually parameterized via tagged template (e.g., `sql\`SELECT ... WHERE id = ${id}\``)
- Token validation code (reading tokens, not hardcoding them)

When a finding requires tracing through multiple files (e.g., user input → handler → service → query), document the **call stack** showing data flow: `file1.ts:line → file2.ts:line → file3.ts:line (sink)`.

### Phase Ordering

Phases MUST run in numerical order (0 → 16). Earlier phases establish context that later phases depend on (e.g., Phase 1 attack surface informs Phase 4 injection analysis). Skipping phases is only permitted when the user explicitly requests a single phase via the `phase` argument.

## Phase 0: Preflight

Before deep analysis, capture:

- Scope, assumptions, and explicit exclusions.
- Current commit hash and branch.
- Tech stack discovery: frameworks, languages, databases, auth libraries, ORM/query layer.
- Available security-related scripts (audit, lint, SAST, DAST).
- Environment constraints (missing secrets, unavailable services, tooling limits).
- Applicable compliance frameworks (identify from project docs, domain, or user input).

Output a preflight block so readers understand confidence boundaries.

## Phase 1: Attack Surface Discovery

Scan and document:

- All entry points: HTTP routes, WebSocket handlers, GraphQL resolvers, CLI commands, cron jobs, queue consumers.
- Authentication boundaries: which endpoints are public vs protected.
- Trust boundaries: user input, inter-service calls, third-party integrations, file uploads.
- Data stores: databases, caches, file storage, external APIs.
- Privileged operations: admin routes, bulk operations, data exports, deletion endpoints.
- Deployment surface: exposed ports, public URLs, cloud service endpoints.

Include a trust-boundary diagram (Mermaid or text) showing data flow and trust transitions.

## Phase 2: Authentication (AuthN)

### A) Authentication Mechanism

- Identify auth strategy (JWT, session, OAuth, API key, mTLS, etc.).
- Token generation: sufficient entropy, secure signing algorithm (RS256/ES256 preferred over HS256 for multi-service).
- Token storage: httpOnly + secure + sameSite cookies preferred; no localStorage for auth tokens.
- Token lifetime: access token short-lived (15-60 min), refresh token with rotation.
- Session invalidation: logout actually invalidates server-side (not just client-side token deletion).

### B) Credential Handling

- Password hashing: bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 with appropriate cost factor (not MD5/SHA).
- No plaintext passwords in logs, error messages, or API responses.
- Brute-force protection: rate limiting on login, account lockout or exponential backoff.
- Password reset flow: time-limited tokens, single-use, no password in URL/email body.

### C) Multi-factor and Elevated Auth

- MFA support where required by compliance or risk profile.
- Step-up authentication for sensitive operations (password change, role escalation, data export).
- Session binding: tokens tied to device/IP where appropriate.

### D) Auth Middleware Consistency

- Every protected route passes through auth middleware (no gaps).
- Auth middleware is applied at the router/framework level, not per-handler.
- Failed auth returns consistent error format (no information leakage about user existence).

## Phase 3: Authorization (AuthZ)

### A) Access Control Model

- Identify model: RBAC, ABAC, ACL, or hybrid.
- Roles/permissions are server-defined (not trusting client-supplied roles).
- Role hierarchy and permission inheritance is explicit and documented.

### B) Route-Level Enforcement

- Every mutation endpoint has authorization checks.
- Read endpoints filter data by user scope (tenant, org, jurisdiction, ownership).
- No endpoints that return all records without scope filtering.
- Admin/superuser routes have explicit role gates.

### C) Resource-Level Authorization

- Object-level access checks: user can only access resources they own or are authorized for.
- No IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference): sequential IDs with authorization, or use UUIDs.
- Bulk operations enforce per-item authorization (not just top-level check).
- File/attachment access respects the same auth rules as the parent resource.

### D) Privilege Escalation Prevention

- Role assignment/modification requires admin authorization.
- Users cannot modify their own role or permissions.
- API does not expose role-change endpoints without proper gates.
- Token refresh does not silently escalate privileges.

## Phase 4: Input Validation and Injection Prevention

### A) SQL Injection

- All database queries use parameterized queries or ORM methods (no string concatenation).
- Raw SQL usage is audited: search for raw query patterns and verify parameterization.
- Dynamic table/column names are validated against allowlists (not user-supplied).

### B) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Framework auto-escaping is enabled and not bypassed (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, `|safe` without sanitization).
- User-generated content rendered in HTML is sanitized (DOMPurify or equivalent).
- Content-Security-Policy header is set and restrictive.
- JSON responses use `application/json` content type (not `text/html`).

### C) Command Injection

- No `exec()`, `spawn()`, `system()`, `eval()` with user-supplied input.
- If shell commands are necessary, use allowlisted commands with parameterized arguments.
- File paths constructed from user input are validated and sandboxed.

### D) Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- URLs from user input are validated against allowlists.
- Internal/private IP ranges are blocked for outbound requests.
- Redirect following is disabled or limited for server-side HTTP calls.

### E) Schema Validation

- All API inputs validated against schemas (Zod, Joi, JSON Schema, etc.) before processing.
- Validation happens server-side (client-side validation is UX only, not security).
- File uploads validated: type, size, content inspection (not just extension).
- Reject unexpected fields (strict schemas, no `additionalProperties: true` by default).

### F) Path Traversal

- File paths sanitized: no `../` traversal.
- Upload destinations use generated filenames (not user-supplied).
- Static file serving restricted to intended directories.

### G) Business Logic and Race Conditions

- State machine transitions enforce guards (no skipping states via direct API calls).
- Time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities: check and action must be atomic (e.g., use DB transactions for check-then-update).
- Workflow state transitions protected by optimistic concurrency (row version / etag).
- Payment or approval flows cannot be bypassed by replaying or reordering API calls.
- Concurrent operations on the same resource are handled safely (e.g., two officers approving the same task simultaneously).

## Phase 5: Data Protection and Privacy

### A) Sensitive Data Identification

- Inventory PII fields: names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, government IDs, biometrics, financial data.
- Classify data sensitivity levels across the schema.
- Identify regulated data subject to specific compliance requirements.

### B) Encryption

- Data in transit: TLS enforced (HSTS, no mixed content, certificate validation).
- Data at rest: database-level or field-level encryption for sensitive columns.
- Encryption keys managed properly (not hardcoded, rotatable, separate from data).

### C) Data Minimization and Access

- API responses return only necessary fields (no over-fetching of sensitive data).
- PII is masked/redacted in logs, error messages, and non-privileged API responses.
- Sensitive fields (SSN, passwords, tokens) are never included in GET query parameters.
- Audit-relevant data (who accessed what PII) is logged.

### D) Data Retention and Deletion

- Retention policies defined and enforced (soft-delete vs hard-delete).
- Deletion cascades correctly (no orphaned PII in related tables).
- Backup/archive data subject to same retention rules.
- Right-to-erasure capability if applicable.

### E) Data Integrity

- Critical records (audit logs, evidence, transactions) are append-only or immutable.
- Hash/checksum verification for evidence files or integrity-critical data.
- Chain-of-custody tracking for items that change hands (evidence, case files, assets).
- Tampering detection: audit logs cannot be silently modified or deleted.

## Phase 6: Secrets Management

### A) Secret Detection

Search entire codebase for:

- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings.
- Secrets in environment files committed to git.
- Secrets in Dockerfiles, CI configs, or infrastructure-as-code.
- Private keys or certificates in the repository.
- Base64-encoded secrets (decode and verify).

### B) Secret Storage

- Production secrets stored in a secrets manager (not environment files or config files).
- Development secrets in `.env` files excluded from git (`.gitignore`).
- `.env.example` files contain placeholder values only (not real secrets).
- No secrets passed as build arguments that persist in image layers.

### C) Secret Rotation

- Secrets are rotatable without code deployment.
- Database credentials, API keys, and signing keys have rotation procedures.
- No hardcoded references that would break on rotation.

## Phase 7: Audit Trail and Logging

### A) Audit Completeness

- All authentication events logged (login, logout, failed attempts, token refresh).
- All authorization decisions logged (access granted/denied, with context).
- All data mutations logged (create, update, delete — who, what, when).
- All sensitive data access logged (PII views, exports, downloads).
- All administrative actions logged (role changes, config changes, user management).

### B) Audit Integrity

- Audit logs are append-only (no update/delete capability through the application).
- Log entries include: timestamp, actor ID, action, resource, outcome, IP/session context.
- Structured logging format (JSON) for machine parsability.
- Correlation IDs link related events across services.

### C) Log Safety

- No sensitive data in logs: passwords, tokens, PII, full credit card numbers.
- Log levels appropriate: security events at WARN/ERROR, not DEBUG-only.
- Log retention sufficient for compliance and incident investigation.
- Logs shipped to centralized, tamper-resistant storage in production.

### D) Monitoring and Alerting

- Failed authentication spike detection.
- Authorization violation alerting.
- Anomalous data access pattern detection (bulk exports, unusual hours).
- Health and availability monitoring for auth services.

## Phase 8: Dependency Security

### A) Known Vulnerabilities

Run and analyze:

```bash
# Node.js
npm audit --production
npm audit --production --audit-level=high

# Python
pip-audit || safety check

# General
# Check for CVE databases against manifest files
```

- Flag: critical and high severity CVEs in production dependencies.
- Identify: dependencies with no recent maintenance (abandoned packages).
- Verify: lockfile is committed and `npm ci` (or equivalent) is used in CI/builds.

### B) Supply Chain Risks

- Dependencies pinned to exact versions or lockfile (no floating ranges for critical packages).
- CI/CD actions pinned to SHA (not floating tags like `@latest` or `@v3`).
- No `postinstall` scripts that download or execute remote code.
- Package source is verified (official registry, no typosquatting risk).

### C) Transitive Dependencies

- Audit transitive dependency tree for known vulnerabilities.
- Identify deeply nested dependencies with security implications.
- Flag deprecated packages that may stop receiving security patches.

## Phase 9: Network and Transport Security

### A) TLS and Encryption in Transit

- All external communication over HTTPS/TLS.
- TLS version 1.2+ enforced (no SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1).
- Certificate validation not disabled in production code.
- HSTS header set with appropriate max-age.

### B) CORS Configuration

- Allowed origins are specific (not `*` in production).
- Credentials mode is restrictive.
- Preflight caching is configured.
- CORS is applied to all endpoints (not just some).

### C) API Security Headers

Verify presence of:

- `Content-Security-Policy` (restrictive).
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`.
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or stricter.
- `Permissions-Policy` (restrict camera, microphone, geolocation).
- `Cache-Control: no-store` for sensitive responses.

### D) Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints.
- Rate limiting on API endpoints (per-user or per-IP).
- Request size limits configured.
- Slowloris/connection exhaustion protection (timeouts configured).

## Phase 10: Container and Runtime Security

### A) Container Hardening

- Non-root user in Dockerfiles (numeric UID, not root).
- Minimal base images (alpine or distroless).
- No unnecessary tools (curl, wget, shell) in production images.
- Read-only filesystem where possible.
- No privileged mode or elevated capabilities.

### B) Runtime Configuration

- Debug mode disabled in production.
- Stack traces not exposed to clients in production error responses.
- Admin/debug endpoints disabled or auth-gated in production.
- Unnecessary services/ports not exposed.

### C) Supply Chain (Build Pipeline)

- Build pipeline uses trusted base images (pinned versions, not `latest`).
- No secrets in image layers (multi-stage builds, no `ENV SECRET=...`).
- Image scanning in CI (Trivy, Snyk, etc.) if available.
- Signed images or content trust if applicable.

## Phase 11: Compliance Assessment

### A) Standards Checklist

Based on discovered domain and applicable frameworks, assess against relevant standards. Common frameworks:

**OWASP Top 10:**

| # | Risk | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|---|------|--------|----------|-----|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | | | |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | | | |
| A03 | Injection | | | |
| A04 | Insecure Design | | | |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | | | |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components | | | |
| A07 | Auth Failures | | | |
| A08 | Software/Data Integrity | | | |
| A09 | Logging/Monitoring Failures | | | |
| A10 | SSRF | | | |

**Data Protection (if PII is handled):**

- Data classification scheme exists.
- Consent/legal basis for data processing documented.
- Data subject rights supported (access, rectification, erasure).
- Data breach notification procedures defined.
- Cross-border data transfer controls if applicable.

**Domain-Specific Compliance:**

- If requirements documents exist (BRD, SRS, etc.), map security controls to requirements.
- Identify regulatory requirements from project context (healthcare, financial, law enforcement, etc.).
- Flag unmet compliance obligations.

### B) Requirements Traceability

If requirements documents are available, produce a mapping:

| Requirement ID | Security Requirement | Evidence | Status | Gap | Next Step |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|--------|-----|-----------|

## Phase 12: QA Gates and Security Verdict

Assess each gate as `PASS`, `PARTIAL`, `FAIL`.

Blocking gates:

1. **Authentication integrity** — All protected routes behind auth; no bypass paths.
2. **Authorization enforcement** — RBAC/scope checks on every mutation and data read.
3. **Injection prevention** — Parameterized queries; input validation on all endpoints.
4. **Secret safety** — No secrets in code, config, or image layers.
5. **Data protection** — PII encrypted/masked; sensitive data not in logs or URLs.
6. **Audit trail** — Security-relevant events logged with actor, action, outcome.
7. **Dependency safety** — No critical/high CVEs in production dependencies.
8. **Transport security** — TLS enforced; security headers present.

Non-blocking gates:

1. **Container hardening** — Non-root, minimal image, read-only FS.
2. **Rate limiting** — Abuse prevention on auth and API endpoints.
3. **Monitoring and alerting** — Security event detection and notification.
4. **Compliance coverage** — Applicable standards assessed and mapped.

Verdict policy:

- Any blocking gate `FAIL` => `CRITICAL`.
- Blocking gates all `PASS` or `PARTIAL` with no `FAIL` and 2+ `PARTIAL` => `AT-RISK`.
- Blocking gates all `PASS` with at most 1 `PARTIAL` => `SECURE`.

Verdict block:

```text
AuthN Status:         [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
AuthZ Status:         [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
Injection Status:     [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
Data Protection:      [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
Blocking Gates:       X/8 PASS, Y/8 PARTIAL, Z/8 FAIL
Non-Blocking Gates:   X/4 PASS, Y/4 PARTIAL, Z/4 FAIL
Security Verdict:     [SECURE | AT-RISK | CRITICAL]
```

## Phase 13: Bugs and Foot-Guns

Minimum counts:

- Full-repo review: `10+` P0/P1 and `10+` P2 findings.
- Scoped review: `5+` P0/P1 and `5+` P2 findings.

Each finding must include:

- Severity, confidence, and status.
- Exact file:line evidence.
- Security impact statement (what an attacker could exploit).
- Specific fix with code-level guidance.
- Verification steps.

## Phase 14: Remediation Backlog

Backlog size:

- Full-repo: `25-50` items.
- Scoped: `10-25` items.

| ID | Title | Priority | Risk Score | Effort | Category | Where | Threat | Fix | Verify | Dependencies |
|----|-------|----------|------------|--------|----------|-------|--------|-----|--------|--------------|

Priority:

- `P0`: critical — active exploit risk, fix immediately.
- `P1`: high — fix this sprint.
- `P2`: medium — next sprint.
- `P3`: low — hardening.

Effort:

- `S`: under 2 hours.
- `M`: 2 hours to 2 days.
- `L`: more than 2 days.

## Phase 15: Quick Wins and Stabilization

- Quick wins (2 hours): `5-10` fixes with immediate security improvement.
- 2-day stabilization: `8-15` fixes that materially reduce attack surface.

Each task must include exact file targets and verification steps.

### Common Security Fix Patterns

| Finding | Fix Pattern |
|---------|-------------|
| SQL injection (`query("... " + input)`) | Use parameterized query: `query("... $1", [input])` |
| Missing auth on route | Add auth middleware: `{ preHandler: [requireAuth] }` |
| Secret in source code | Move to `.env`, add to `.gitignore`, rotate the exposed secret |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | Use DOMPurify: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(html) }}` |
| Missing CORS origin restriction | Set specific origins: `origin: ["https://app.example.com"]` |
| Password in logs | Redact: `logger.info({ ...req.body, password: "[REDACTED]" })` |
| Missing rate limiting | Add `@fastify/rate-limit` with `max: 100, timeWindow: "1 minute"` |
| JWT in localStorage | Move to httpOnly cookie with `secure: true, sameSite: "strict"` |

## Phase 15.1: Impact/Likelihood Calibration

When scoring Risk = Impact x Likelihood, use these calibration examples:

| Impact | Score | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Catastrophic | 5 | Full database dump, admin account takeover, PII mass exposure |
| Major | 4 | Single user account takeover, unauthorized data modification |
| Moderate | 3 | Information disclosure (non-PII), privilege escalation to read-only |
| Minor | 2 | Denial of service on non-critical endpoint, verbose error messages |
| Negligible | 1 | Security header missing, cosmetic cookie attribute |

| Likelihood | Score | Example |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Almost certain | 5 | Public endpoint, no authentication, trivial exploit |
| Likely | 4 | Authenticated endpoint, but common attack pattern (SQLi in search) |
| Possible | 3 | Requires specific conditions (race condition, unusual input format) |
| Unlikely | 2 | Requires insider access or chained exploits |
| Rare | 1 | Requires physical access or highly specific timing |

## Phase 16: Verification Commands

Adapt commands to the discovered tech stack. Examples:

```bash
# Secret scanning (targeted patterns to reduce noise)
rg -n "(password|secret|api[_-]?key|private[_-]?key)\s*[:=]" --glob '!*.lock' --glob '!node_modules' -i
# Broader sweep for hardcoded credentials
rg -n "password\s*[:=]\s*['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" --glob '*.{ts,js,py,json}' --glob '!*.lock'
rg -n "BEGIN (RSA |EC |DSA |OPENSSH )?PRIVATE KEY" .
rg -n "AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}" .  # AWS access keys

# Auth middleware gaps
rg -n "app\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)\(" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' -C 2
rg -n "router\.(get|post|put|patch|delete)\(" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' -C 2

# Injection risks
rg -n "\.query\(.*\$\{|\.query\(.*\+" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js'
rg -n "exec\(|spawn\(|eval\(" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' --glob '*.py'
rg -n "dangerouslySetInnerHTML|v-html|\|safe" --glob '*.tsx' --glob '*.jsx' --glob '*.vue'

# CORS and headers
rg -n "cors|Access-Control-Allow-Origin" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' --glob '*.conf' -C 3
rg -n "helmet|security.*header" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js'

# Sensitive data in logs
rg -n "console\.log|logger\.(info|debug|warn|error)" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js' -C 2

# Dependency audit
npm audit --production 2>/dev/null || pip-audit 2>/dev/null || echo "No supported package manager audit found"

# Docker security
rg -n "^USER|^EXPOSE|ENV.*SECRET|ENV.*PASSWORD|ENV.*KEY" Dockerfile*
rg -n "privileged|cap_add" docker-compose*.yml
```

Record each command as `Executed` or `Not Executed` with reason.
